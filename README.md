HTML content creation.

### Step 2:
Design of webserver workflow.

### Step 3:
Implementation using Python code.

### Step 4:
Import the necessary modules.

### Step 5:
Define a custom request handler.

### Step 6:
Start an HTTP server on a specific port.

    <center><h1>JUPITER</h1></center>
    <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.<br>
         It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning.<br>
          It is covered in swirling cloud stripes.<br>
           It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.</p>

           <p> It has many moons, including the four large Galilean moons - Io, Europa,
             Ganymede, and Callisto, which are visible with a telescope from Earth.<br>
             Though Jupiter has rings, they are very faint and not easily seen. </p>
